{"question": "How does photosynthesis convert light into chemical energy?", "answer": "Photosynthesis converts light into chemical energy through a multi-step process: 1) Light is absorbed by chlorophyll in chloroplasts. 2) Light energy splits water molecules, releasing oxygen. 3) The energy is used to create ATP and NADPH. 4) These molecules power the Calvin cycle to fix CO2 into glucose. This process stores solar energy in chemical bonds."}
{"question": "Why does ice float on water?", "answer": "Ice floats on water due to hydrogen bonding: 1) Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other. 2) When water freezes, molecules arrange in a hexagonal crystal structure. 3) This structure has more space between molecules than liquid water. 4) Less dense arrangement means ice is less dense than water. 5) Less dense materials float on more dense ones, so ice floats."}
{"question": "Explain how vaccines work to protect against diseases", "answer": "Vaccines work through immune system training: 1) A vaccine introduces a weakened or inactive pathogen to the body. 2) The immune system recognizes it as foreign and produces antibodies. 3) Memory cells are created that remember this pathogen. 4) If the real pathogen enters later, memory cells quickly produce antibodies. 5) The rapid immune response prevents or reduces disease severity."}
{"question": "How do airplanes generate lift to fly?", "answer": "Airplanes generate lift through aerodynamic principles: 1) The wing has a curved top surface and flatter bottom surface. 2) Air travels faster over the curved top, slower under the bottom. 3) Faster-moving air creates lower pressure (Bernoulli's principle). 4) Higher pressure below the wing pushes up more than pressure above pushes down. 5) This pressure difference creates an upward force called lift."}
{"question": "Why do seasons change throughout the year?", "answer": "Seasons change due to Earth's axial tilt: 1) Earth's axis is tilted 23.5 degrees relative to its orbital plane. 2) As Earth orbits the sun, different hemispheres tilt toward the sun. 3) When tilted toward the sun, a hemisphere receives more direct sunlight. 4) More direct sunlight means more solar energy and warmer temperatures (summer). 5) When tilted away, sunlight is less direct, creating cooler temperatures (winter)."}
